# I. Introduction
Sign Language Processing (SLP) is a field of research that focuses on the development of technologies that can understand and generate sign language, with the rise of Artificial Intelligence, deep learning and computer vision technologies, the field of SLP has seen significant advancements in recent years.

## Objective

- The primary objective of this project is to develop a Cambodia Sign Recognition Model by using deep learning and deploy on web application for Cambodia Sign Language Translation, which is using real-time camera to recognize Cambodia sign languages gesture and Translate it to text and Khmer Spoken.

- At the initial stage: the application begins with web application which allows users to perform sign language in front of the camera attached to and the webcam of laptops. The Recognition model can recognition 21 signs (classes).

## Scope of work
- Data Collection (Currently we got 21 signs)
- Training Model (Used LSTM)
- Evaluate our Model
- Real-Time Inference (Check speed and Accuracy)
- Integrated with Text-To-Speech Model ( used TTS APIs)
- Deploy in web application (Used Flask Frameworks)
